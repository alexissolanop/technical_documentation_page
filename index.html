              <p>Succulent plants have become so popular because they offer low maintenance and diverse shapes and textures, both in gardens and indoors. Crassula is a diverse and extensive genus of succulent plants, with about 350 species total. Probably the most well-known of the group is the jade plant (Crassula ovata)—many know it as a houseplant, but in warm climates, it actually grows into a shrub.</p>
              <p>Crassula plants range from annuals to perennials, herbaceous or woody plants, groundcovers to shrubs to small trees. Many species are small, including some miniatures and creeping ground covers. With the resurgence of succulent container gardening, these smaller Crassula species are becoming more readily available, and their easy-growing habit makes them worth getting to know. They are perfect container plants—low maintenance, evergreen, and eye-catching.</p>

              <code>Depending on your climate, Crassula plants can be either garden plants or indoor potted specimens.</code>
              <p> Given their low water needs, jade plants and other Crassula species are ideal for people who tend to neglect their plants. They are very hard to kill and very easy to propagate from cuttings. Even a single leaf that falls from the plant will often take root in potting mix. However, don't completely neglect your plant—it still needs water!</p>
              <p>Crassula can be sensitive to temperature. Too hot, and they will go dormant and drop their lower leaves—too cold, and they will fail to grow or thrive. Other than that, they tend to tolerate neglect just fine. With all species, you can aggressively cut the plants back whenever they get straggly or leggy.</p>

              <code>Most Crassula plants need some shade in the hottest part of summer but require bright light to attain their most vibrant color.</code>
              <p> When grown outdoors, a site with morning sun and afternoon shade is perfect (if placed in full sun all day, the leaves may scald).</p>
              <p>When grown indoors, place your plants in a spot that receives bright indirect light all day, or direct sun for six hours of the day. A southern-facing window is ideal.</p>

              <code>Crassulas need a dry soil.</code>
              <p>Crassula plants need soil that is very well-draining and will do best in sandy, rocky blends formulated especially for succulents.</p>
              <p>They prefer neutral to slightly acidic soil, but even extreme pH levels rarely kill the plant. Crassula plants will react badly to boggy, wet soils, as their roots can easily rot.</p>

              <code>As a general rule of thumb, succulent plants prefer sparse watering.</code>
              <p>To avoid overwatering, soak the plant, allow it to drain completely, then wait for the soil to dry out before watering again. During cooler months, you can reduce watering, as the roots can rot in cold, wet soil.</p>
              <p>Crassula plants begin actively growing in the spring, so watch for a slight increase in watering needs. When grown indoors, watering should be minimized from late fall through winter, as the plants go semi-dormant during this time.</p>
